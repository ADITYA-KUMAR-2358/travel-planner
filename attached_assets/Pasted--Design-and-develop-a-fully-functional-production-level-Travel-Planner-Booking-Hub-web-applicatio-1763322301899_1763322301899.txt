"Design and develop a fully functional, production-level Travel Planner & Booking Hub web application inspired by the provided UI screens, including the navigation bar, search section, holiday filter area, listing cards, destination details button, newsletter subscription box, footer links, social icons, partner links, and copyright section. Build the frontend using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and connect it with MongoDB or any other free open-source database. All integrations must be 100% free and open-source. Implement interactive features for all visible UI elements: destination search bar, calendar date picker, max-price slider with live price updates, filter modal triggered by the “More Filters” button, responsive navbar buttons (Home, Packages, Shop, About, Pages, News, Contact), and a working “BOOK NOW” CTA. Add functionality to all card elements including location tag, price, description preview, and a fully functional “DETAILS” button that opens a detailed trip page with itinerary, photos, reviews, map view, and booking options. Integrate Leaflet.js with OpenStreetMap tiles to display maps for destinations. Include an itinerary builder where users can add or edit their travel schedule, a booking management module to store trip reservations, and a review & ratings system for destinations. Implement a working newsletter subscription form with email validation and store subscriber data in the backend. Add functional footer links for Services, Insurance, Agency, Tourism, Payment, Partners, Last Minute Destinations, and integrate social media icons with hover animations. Build clean RESTful APIs, secure CRUD operations, authentication, route protection, form validation, and image handling using free solutions only. Ensure a modern, responsive UI with reusable components, state management, clean architecture, and deploy both frontend and backend on free hosting platforms. The final app must look visually identical to the reference images and include fully working interactions for every visible button, input field, filter, link, icon, card, and CTA."
